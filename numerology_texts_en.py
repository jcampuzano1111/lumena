MASTER_MEANINGS = {
    11: {
        "title": "The Illuminated Messenger – The Intuitive Visionary",
        "essence": "Eleven is a Master Number of intuition, extreme sensitivity, and spiritual inspiration.",
        "expanded": """Eleven is the first and most intense of the Master Numbers, known as the “Illuminated 
Messenger”. It represents the doorway between the material and spiritual worlds – the ability to perceive the 
invisible and bring light from higher dimensions.

Those who carry this number are old souls with an evolutionary mission: to elevate collective consciousness 
and act as channels of divine inspiration. They are not here to live an ordinary life; their purpose is 
transcendental and their impact deep. Eleven vibrates at a much higher frequency than its reduction (2), 
which brings extraordinary gifts but also very intense challenges.

INTENSE DUALITY: Elevens experience life in extremes. They can reach states of deep illumination where everything 
makes sense, then fall into existential crises where nothing does. This emotional and spiritual roller coaster 
is part of their path of mastery.

EXTREME SENSITIVITY: They are like hypersensitive antennas that pick up everything: others’ emotions, subtle energies, 
premonitions, synchronicities. This sensitivity can be a prophetic gift or an overwhelming burden. They must learn 
to filter, protect their energy, and avoid absorbing the pain of the world.

NERVOUSNESS AND ANXIETY: The nervous system of an Eleven is constantly overloaded. Anxiety is almost a given; it comes 
from channeling so much subtle energy through a human body. The challenge is learning to manage it without numbing out 
or escaping through addictions.

MISSION OF INSPIRATION: Elevens are not here primarily to do, but to BE and INSPIRE. Their mere presence can change 
the energy of a room. When they speak, others feel something awakening inside. They are catalysts of transformation, 
teachers who teach more through what they embody than through what they say.

GROUNDING CHALLENGE: Their greatest challenge is staying grounded while flying so high spiritually. Many Elevens 
get lost in idealism, fantasy, or ungrounded spirituality. They must learn that true mastery includes paying bills, 
caring for the body, and living responsibly.

COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS: Loving an Eleven means loving someone intense, unpredictable, and deep. They need partners 
who understand their need for solitude, respect their sensitivity, and don’t try to “normalize” them. Their best 
relationships are with those who honor their exceptional nature.

POTENTIAL FOR SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP: When an Eleven accepts their path, they can become a guide, healer, or spiritual 
leader of great impact. Their words carry weight because they come from lived experience, not theory.""",
        "shadow": """- Extreme nervousness and chronic anxiety that can lead to panic attacks
- Tendency toward addictions (alcohol, drugs, food, escapism) to avoid intensity
- Spiritual delusions and magical thinking disconnected from reality
- Excessive idealism that leads to constant disappointment
- Spiritual martyrdom: sacrificing themselves until total exhaustion
- Spiritual arrogance: feeling “more evolved” than others
- Severe emotional instability and dramatic mood swings
- Difficulty functioning in practical, everyday life""",
        "light": """- Prophetic intuition: knowing things without logical explanation
- Ability to inspire deep transformation in others
- Direct connection to spiritual guidance and higher wisdom
- Magnetic presence that attracts and uplifts people
- Clear vision of universal truths and karmic patterns
- Ability to channel creativity, art, or elevated messages
- Deep compassion and understanding of the human condition
- Authentic spiritual leadership based on personal experience""",
        "purpose": """To be a beacon of light in dark times, inspire awakening of consciousness, guide by lived example, 
teach that the impossible is possible, and remind humanity of its divine nature.""",
        "advice": """1. Accept that you are different and stop trying to be “normal”
2. Develop grounding practices: exercise, nature, routines
3. Protect your energy: learn to say no and set clear boundaries
4. Find your tribe: surround yourself with people who understand your sensitivity
5. Channel your intensity creatively: art, writing, music, teaching
6. Don’t run from your mission out of fear – the world needs your light
7. Take care of your nervous system: meditation, rest, conscious nutrition
8. Seek therapy or guidance from someone who understands spiritual sensitivity"""
    },

    22: {
        "title": "The Architect of the World – The Master Builder",
        "essence": "Twenty-two is a Master Number of construction: it unites spiritual vision with very concrete achievements.",
        "expanded": """Twenty-two is the number of the “Master Architect” – the builder of impossible dreams and 
the manifestor of large-scale visions. If Eleven brings the vision, Twenty-two turns it into tangible reality. 
This is the number of great leaders, visionaries, and builders who leave lasting legacies.

Twenty-two combines the spiritual inspiration of Eleven with the practical discipline of Four (its reduction), 
creating one of the most powerful forces in numerology. It is not just about dreaming big, but having the 
capacity, determination, and strategic vision to manifest those dreams in the material world.

LONG-TERM VISION: Twenty-twos don’t think in years; they think in decades or even generations. They see possibilities 
where others see impossibilities. They can imagine complete systems, massive organizations, projects that change 
entire industries. Their mind operates on dimensions others can’t reach.

EXCEPTIONAL MANIFESTATION CAPACITY: While many stay in fantasy, Twenty-twos have the rare gift of turning ideas 
into empires. They possess a unique combination of inspiring idealism and fierce pragmatism. They know how to dream 
AND how to execute. This duality makes them extraordinarily effective.

IMMENSE PRESSURE: Being a Twenty-two is carrying a heavy existential weight. They feel inside that they are here 
for something big, and that feeling can be paralyzing. The gap between their vision and their current reality can 
create deep frustration, especially in youth. Many Twenty-twos feel “different” since childhood, knowing they have 
an important mission but not knowing what it is.

PERFECTIONISM CHALLENGE: Twenty-twos have impossibly high standards. If they are not building something “big enough 
or meaningful enough,” they feel like they are failing. This perfectionism can paralyze them completely or lead to 
total burnout. They must learn that the greatest legacies are built step by step, not in one leap.

NATURAL BUT LONELY LEADERSHIP: Twenty-twos are natural leaders, but their vision often puts them so far ahead that 
few can keep up. This can create deep loneliness. They need to learn to communicate their vision so others can 
understand and join, instead of isolating themselves in their greatness.

PURPOSEFUL MATERIALIZATION: Unlike Eight (which seeks personal power and wealth), Twenty-two builds for the 
collective good. Their deepest motivation is not ego but legacy. They want to leave the world better than they found it, 
and they think big about how to do it.

COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS: Loving a Twenty-two means loving someone who is married to a mission. Their personal relationships 
often suffer because their work consumes their energy. They need partners who understand their need to build something big 
and who can be allies in that vision, not competition for attention.

POTENTIAL FOR MASSIVE IMPACT: When a Twenty-two finds their life project and commits fully, they can literally change 
the world. They are the founders of movements, global organizations, and innovations that transform industries. 
Their legacy outlives their physical life.""",
        "shadow": """- Paralyzing perfectionism that prevents starting or finishing projects
- Brutal self-imposed pressure that leads to severe burnout
- Megalomania: visions so big they become unrealistic or ego-driven
- Work addiction that destroys health, relationships, and personal life
- Chronic frustration when reality doesn’t match their vision
- Tendency to manipulate or control to achieve goals
- Emotional coldness: sacrificing humanity for efficiency
- Nervous collapse when the weight of the mission becomes unbearable""",
        "light": """- Unique capacity to manifest visions into large tangible realities
- Inspiring leadership that moves people toward collective goals
- Exceptional strategic vision that sees 10–20 years ahead
- Strong discipline and determination to sustain long projects
- Ability to organize complex systems and manage large teams
- Elevated pragmatism: they combine spirituality with concrete action
- Potential to create legacies that benefit generations
- Ability to turn the impossible into the inevitable""",
        "purpose": """To build structures, organizations, systems, or projects that positively transform 
the lives of many people. To leave a tangible legacy that outlives them. To show that high spiritual visions 
can be manifested materially.""",
        "advice": """1. Embrace that you are a legacy builder, not a seeker of instant gratification
2. Break your big vision into manageable steps to avoid paralysis
3. Surround yourself with a strong team – you cannot build empires alone
4. Set boundaries between work and personal life or you will burn out
5. Celebrate small wins along the way, not only the final goal
6. Find mentors who have built at large scale
7. Take care of your physical health: your body is the vehicle of your mission
8. Remember: the greatest legacies are built with patience"""

    33: {
        "title": "The Master Healer – The Avatar of Universal Love",
        "essence": "Thirty-three is a Master Number of unconditional love, elevated service, and collective healing.",
        "expanded": """Thirty-three is the rarest and highest of the Master Numbers, known as the “Master Healer” 
or “Avatar of Universal Love”. It represents the highest vibration of spiritual service, the capacity for 
unconditional love, and the vocation to heal human suffering on a large scale.

If Eleven illuminates and Twenty-two builds, Thirty-three HEALS. This number combines the sensitivity of Eleven 
with the manifesting power of Twenty-two, focusing everything on loving service. Thirty-threes are very old souls 
who incarnate specifically to be agents of collective healing in critical times for humanity.

EXCEPTIONAL HEART: Thirty-threes possess a capacity for love that goes beyond normal human standards. They can love 
strangers as family, forgive the unforgivable, see light where others see only darkness. Their heart is a portal 
of infinite compassion, able to hold others’ pain without breaking (though sometimes they do break).

HEALING PRESENCE: Simply BEING near a Thirty-three is therapeutic. Their energy has a naturally healing quality 
that others feel immediately. People feel safe, seen, and loved in their presence. They can walk into a tense room 
and their mere presence calms the atmosphere.

THE WEIGHT OF EXTREME SERVICE: Being a Thirty-three means carrying a very heavy emotional cross. They feel the 
world’s pain viscerally. They cannot witness suffering without wanting to relieve it. This unlimited compassion 
can lead them to extreme exhaustion, self-destructive sacrifice, or severe codependency. Their biggest lesson 
is learning that they cannot save everyone.

MASTERS OF UNCONDITIONAL LOVE: Thirty-threes teach others what it means to love without conditions. They don’t 
just talk about love; they embody it. They are living examples that it is possible to love deeply without clinging, 
to serve without expecting anything in return, and to forgive the unforgivable. Their life itself is their most 
powerful teaching.

EXTREME VULNERABILITY: Their open heart makes them extremely vulnerable to deep wounds. Many Thirty-threes have 
suffered severe emotional trauma, devastating betrayal, or losses that would break others. But these very wounds 
turn them into authentic healers: they heal because they know pain from the inside.

BOUNDARIES CHALLENGE: Thirty-threes must learn the hardest lesson: that true love includes boundaries. Saying “no” 
is not a lack of love – it is mature love. Caring for themselves is not selfish – it is necessary. The paradox for 
Thirty-three is that, to serve more, they must learn to give less. To love better, they must love themselves first.

SPIRITUAL TEACHER VOCATION: When a Thirty-three matures spiritually, they become a teacher, healer, spiritual guide, 
or leader of collective-healing movements. They don’t need formal titles; their authority comes from their loving 
presence and lived wisdom.

INTENSE RELATIONSHIPS: Loving a Thirty-three means receiving love so deep it can be scary. It also means being 
with someone who may exhaust themselves giving to others. Their most successful relationships are with people 
who also care for the caretaker and remind them that they deserve to receive love too.

LEGACY OF HEALING: Thirty-threes are here in times of collective crisis to remind humanity that love is real, 
powerful, and transformative. Their legacy is not material but energetic: the lives they touched, the souls they 
healed, the love they radiated.""",
        "shadow": """- Severe codependency: needing to feel needed to validate their existence
- Martyr syndrome: self-sacrifice to the point of self-destruction
- Inability to set boundaries: saying yes when they should say no
- Chronic emotional and physical exhaustion from giving without receiving
- Tendency to attract toxic relationships where they constantly “rescue” others
- Deep depression when they feel they cannot help enough
- Denial of their own emotional and physical needs
- Savior fantasies: believing they can or must save everyone""",
        "light": """- Authentic unconditional love that transforms those who receive it
- Naturally healing presence that calms and uplifts
- Infinite compassion without judgment or conditions
- Ability to see the best in every person, even in “the worst”
- Capacity for deep forgiveness and release of resentment
- Mastery in holding safe emotional spaces for others
- Deep emotional and spiritual wisdom earned through experience
- Healing impact that goes beyond individuals to the collective""",
        "purpose": """To heal human suffering through unconditional love. To be a living example of 
limitless compassion. To teach that love is the most powerful force in the universe. To remind humanity 
of its capacity to love and forgive. To raise collective vibration simply by their presence.""",
        "advice": """1. Your first act of service is taking care of yourself – you cannot give from emptiness
2. Learn to say no without guilt; boundaries are mature love
3. Seek deep therapy to heal your own wounds before healing others
4. Surround yourself with people who also nourish you – you deserve to receive love
5. Recognize that you cannot (and should not) save everyone
6. Develop NON-negotiable self-care practices
7. Find your tribe of other healers who understand your path
8. Remember: your worth does not depend on how much you give or how many you help"""
